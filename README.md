# AWS SAML Authorization Script.

This is a tool to authenticate to Amazon Web Services using the ADFS SAML provider
and create temporary tokens for use with AWS API clients.

## Two approaches

If you have Docker installed on your workstation, you can run the pre-built
docker image directly from dockerhub. Since this approach requires a number of
parameters to be passed in as environment variables, you will probably want to
create a set of shell aliases, functions, or scripts; we give examples below,
and the git repo (https://github.com/turnerlabs/samlkeygen) includes a file
`docker-aliases.bash` setting up the commands refrenced below; the definitions
may also be found at the bottom of this README.

If you have Python installed on your workstation and prefer to run the script
locally, you can install the module from `PyPI` with `pip install samlkeygen`.
This installs scripts corresponding to the docker aliases, so you will automatically
have a `samld` command in your $PATH once you install the module - even on Windows.

Of course, you can also always clone the git repository and use the source directly.
Pull requests with improvements are always welcome!

### MacOS Note
On modern versions of MacOS, the stock Python install doesn't include `pip`. Even if you
install pip (e.g. with `easy_install`), it will wind up trying to overwrite some readonly
system files when installing some of the packages required by samlkeygen. So for this to
work under MacOS you should install a separate instance of Python, via Homebrew, MacPorts,
virtualenv, or pyenv.

### Required information

The script requires some parameters that are specific to your environment in
order to work; if you don't understand what these are, then ask someone in cloud
operations or administration in your organization. The easiest approach is
probably to set these in the environment in your shell startup files and then
forget about them.

| Option   | Environment Variable | Description|
|----------|----------------------|------------|
|--url     | ADFS\_URL            | Complete URL to ADFS SAML endpoint for AWS
|--domain  | ADFS\_DOMAIN         | Active Directory/ADFS domain name|
|--user    | USER                 | Your Active Directory sAMAccountName  |

Depending on your environment, you may also have to be on your corporate LAN or
VPN in order to authenticate. Once you have keys for a profile, though, those
should work from anywhere until they expire.

### Quick start

`samlkeygen` has two basic functions: the primary one is authentication mode, which
connects to the ADFS endpoint, authenticates, and gets authorization tokens for
the user's defined SAML roles. The secondary function is a set of mechanisms for
easily selecting a profile from the AWS credentials file for a command, without
having to specify the full profile name.

#### Authentication

SAML-based credentials are only good for an hour (a hard AWS-imposed limit). To
make this limit less inconvenient, `samlkeygen` provides a mode of operation that
requests your password once, then runs continually and automatically requests
new credentials every hour before the old ones expire. The supplied aliases/
entry points include `samld`, which can be run without arguments if the environment
variables are set properly, or with just `-u sAMAccountName` if that isn't the
same as your local `$USER` on your workstation.  Example:

```
$ samld -u gpburdell
...
Writing credentials for profile aws-shared-services:aws-shared-services-admin
Writing credentials for profile aws-shared-services:aws-shared-services-dns
Writing credentials for profile aws-ent-prod:aws-ent-prod-admin
Writing credentials for profile cdubs:aws-cdubs-admin
58 minutes till credential refresh
```


### Profile selection

The authentication tokens will be written out to your credentials file with a
separate profile for each SAML role, named `$ACCOUNT_ALIAS:$ROLE_NAME`. You can
get a list of your profiles by running the `list-profiles` subcommand, which
takes an optional parameter to restrict the output to those profiles matching
a substring (really a regular expression). There's an `awsprofs` alias/entry point
for this functionality:


```
$ awsprofs shared-services
aws-shared-services:aws-shared-services-admin
aws-shared-services:aws-shared-services-dns-cnn
```

These are normal AWS profiles and can be used like any other, by supplying the
`--profile` option to whatever AWS CLI command you are running,
or setting the `AWS_PROFILE` environment variable (or `AWS_DEFAULT_PROFILE` for
some older tools).

However, since the autogenerated names are somewhat long, the script also has a
subcommand that lets you select a profile via substring or regular expression
match: `select-profile` works just like `list-profiles`, but requires that the
pattern match exactly one profile. The supplied aliases/entry points include
one called `awsprof` (singular) for this use case:

```
$ awsprof shared-services
samlkeygen.py: Pattern is not unique. It matches these profiles:
        aws-shared-services:aws-shared-services-admin
        aws-shared-services:aws-shared-services-dns-cnn
```

If the pattern does match one profile, that profile's full name is output by itself;
the intent is to use the command in command-substitution:

```
$ aws --profile $(awsprof shared-services-admin) iam list-account-aliases
{
    "AccountAliases": [
        "aws-shared-services"
    ]
}
```

Finally, if you are running the local Python version, you can ask the script to run a
command for you under a given profile. The pip-installed entry poitns include one
called `awsrun` for this function; there's no corresponding Docker alias because the Docker
container would have to include the AWS command-line tool you wanted to run this way.

That lets me replace the above example with this:

```
$ awsrun shared-services-admin aws iam list-account-aliases
{
    "AccountAliases": [
        "aws-shared-services"
    ]
}
```

You can get detailed help about the various options by running `samlkeygen`
directly (via Docker or Python) with the `--help` flag.


#### The Docker aliases

```
alias samld='docker run -it --rm -v "${AWS_DIR:-$HOME/.aws}:/aws" -e "USER=$USER" \
             -e "ADFS_DOMAIN=$ADFS_DOMAIN" -e "ADFS_URL=$ADFS_URL" \
             turnerlabs/samlkeygen authenticate --all-accounts --auto-update'
alias awsprofs='docker run --rm -v ~/.aws:/aws turnerlabs/samlkeygen list-profiles'
alias awsprof='docker run --rm -v ~/.aws:/aws turnerlabs/samlkeygen select-profile'
```
